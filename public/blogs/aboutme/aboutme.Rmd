Hello, my name is Joseph Perrin, I am a 22 years old french student. I recently started my Master in Analytics and Management (MAM) at London Business School.  
Having lived most of my life in a foreign environment (France, Italy, Switzerland, Netherlands and Belgium) and studied in three educational systems, I have developed great open-mindedness and excellent cross-cultural skills. Pursuing my undergraduate studies in Rotterdam School of Management has further increased my exposure to global business matters.

My previously gained academic and professional experiences have shown me how important data analytics are in developing more efficient and sustainable business models. Feeling particularly enthusiastic about driving sustainable impact across the governmental, social and environmental sphere, I joined the MAM program with the specific ambition to acquire the necessary analytical tools to have impact within my environment.
