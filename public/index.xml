      <description>Let’s load the libraries
Climate change and temperature anomalies With the year 2019 concluding the ‘hotest’ decade since 1850, when global temperature started to be recorded, the year 2020 is subject to the same phenomenon. While scientists are becoming more and more alarmist, the predictions of temperature evolution are inreasingly pessimistic. Let us have a look at the variation of the weather since 1880. For this purpose, we can find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</description>

      <description>As Covid-19 second wave bursts in Europes, let us try to use our analytical skills to uncover some trends in COVID-19 pandemic. We will try to determine whether prior medical conditions has any impact on death rate of COVID-19 patients, and whether there is a significant difference in death rate if an individual was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), depending on sex group and age.
Let us revisit the CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data.</description>

IMDB ratings: Differences between directors 
Let’s use the the IMBD data set to analyse the rating performance of some of the best movies directors. We explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. We have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.</description>

      <description>Tadej Pogacar, on his way to winning the 2020 Tour de France
Background Information As the Tour de France 2020 is currently underway, the peloton will have to ride over 3500km in a bit less than 3 weeks. While the outcome of this year’s Tour, the first one to happen in September, is quite certain, this race is usually the theatre of much suspense and drama. Every year since 1903, the Tour de France is a cycling race taking place in the summer which slowly became inherent to the french culture.</description>
